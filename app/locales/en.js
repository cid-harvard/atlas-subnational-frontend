      capabilities needed to extract it can't
      be used to make many other products. That's
      why bananas are a low opportunity product.`,
    2: `Here we arrange products by the similarity of the
      capabilities required in their production, given international
      patterns. %@'s current exports are circled in
      blue. Follow the links from those exports to see more products
      that %@ could start exporting`,
    3: `But %@ doesn't just want more products,
      it wants complex products that require sophisticated capabilities
      that are not common to many countries. This is not the
      case of bananas, which is produced by almost every country
      that has banana trees. We shade products green by their
      complexity—that is, how many countries export them.`
